    <h3>Overview</h3>

    <p>It is well known that certain kinds of tasks are better
      suited for parallel architectures than others.  Heavily
      imperative, sequential code does not parallelize well at
      all, while data-parellel code runs exceptionally well.
      The gray area in between, of non-uniform parallelism, is
      more difficult to map onto parallel architectures.</p>

    <p>Recent years have seen an increasing interest in the
      use of <i>General Purpose GPU</i> computation, where
      graphics cards are being used as coprocessors to speed up
      many kinds of software problems.  In this work, we
      examined how well non-uniform parallel problems fit onto
      a GPU architecture, and specifically focused
      on <i>parsing</i>, a well-studied problem with known
      opportunities for parallelism.  The goal was to see how
      much of a speedup was provided by the GPGPU, and how
      difficult it was to achive that improvement.</p>

    <p>Over the course of a ten-week intership at AT&amp;T
      Reseach, I implemented the
      <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earley_algorithm"
         title="Earley parsing algorithm">Earley parsing
        algorithm</a> with several different optimizations for the
      GPGPU.  Ultimately, we failed to achieve any speedup (by
      the end of the summer, we had reached amortized parity
      with the simple CPU algorithm), but in so doing we learned
      several programming idioms and difficulties with the GPGPU
      style of coding.</p>
