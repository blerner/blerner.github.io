    <h3>Motivation</h3>
    <p>
      Client-side web programs take advantage of ...
    </p>
    <h3>Approach</h3>
    <p>An extension is a self-contained piece of code that
      inserts itself in various places in the browser in order
      to implement its feature.  In other words, it is very much
      like <i>aspect-oriented</i> coding, which similarly weaves
      advice code into a mainline program.  The fundamental
      difference here is that extensions are always written by
      people other than the browser developers, whereas
      typically aspects are written by the mainline authors.
      Our first effort, therefore, has been to add aspects to
      Javascript, so that we can rewrite extensions more
      declaratively, to state explicitly what they're hooking in
      the browser.  This work has been done in Spur, a Microsoft
      Research JScript compiler.</p>
    <p>Additional work is under way to explore other forms of
      extension hooks, such as how overlays inject new content
      into HTML, and characterize the kinds of conflicts those
      hooks entail.  Knowing this, we can begin to develop
      static analyses that detect weaving violations or other
      semantic problems, and thereby detect when extensions
      conflict.</p>
