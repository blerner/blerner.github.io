            <h3>Abstract</h3>
            <p>Integrating computing into other subjects promises to
                 address many challenges to offering standalone CS
                 courses in K-12 contexts. Integrated curricula must
                 be designed carefully, however, to both meet learning
                 objectives of the host discipline and to gain
                 traction with teachers. We describe the multi-year
                 evolution of Bootstrap, a curriculum for integrating
                 computing into middle- and high-school
                 mathematics. We discuss the initial design and the
                 various modifications we have made over the years to
                 better support math instruction, leading to our goal
                 of using integrated curricula to cover standards in
                 both math and CS. We provide advice for others aiming
                 for integration and raise questions for CS educators
                 about how we might better support learning in other disciplines.
