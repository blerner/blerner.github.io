            <h3>Abstract</h3>
            <p>An extensible system permits multiple third-parties to
              add to, revise, or fundamentally alter the functionality provided by
              the base system. System extensibility is a spectrum: on one extreme is
              a completely hard-coded system with no extensions permitted; at the
              far extreme is a system that provides the barest minimum of hard-coded
              support and expects all functionality to be provided as extensions. As
              the capabilities of extensions grow, so too does the likelihood and
              severity of conflicts among extensions. Working with these systems
              thus requires a solid understanding of the <i>extensibility model</i>
              they provide: what exactly are extensions capable of doing, both to
              the underlying system and to each other, and what can go wrong when
              extensions interact?</p>

            <p>Recently, a new extensible system has grown in
              importance: the web browser. Browser vendors have experimented with
              various extensibility mechanisms, but little systematic work has been
              done to understand the design space. In this report we examine several
              types of systems that prominently deal with
              extensibilityaspect-oriented programming, operating systems, feature
              specification, and security monitorsand explore the extensibility
              model taken by several illustrative papers in these areas. We develop
              a classification scheme for the extension design space and show that
              in each area the scope of extensibility can vary widely. Finally, we
              position the web browser in this design space, and show techniques
              from these systems may be adapted to the browser.</p>
