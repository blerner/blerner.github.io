            <h3>Abstract</h3>
            <p>The past few years have seen a growing trend in
              application development toward &ldquo;web
              applications&rdquo;, a fuzzy category of programs that
              currently (but not necessarily) run within web browsers,
              that rely heavily on network servers for data storage,
              and that are developed and deployed differently from
              traditional desktop applications.  Where (typical)
              traditional applications are <i>compiled</i> pieces of
              code, written in <i>arbitrary</i> languages, that
              implement both an application's user interface and its
              functionality, web apps by contrast are written
              in <i>three interpreted</i> languages: <code>HTML</code>
              to define the <i>structure</i> or content of
              the <code>UI</code>, <code>CSS</code> to define
              the <i>appearance</i>, and JavaScript (<code>JS</code>)
              to define the <i>behavior</i>.  These three languages
              feel nothing alike, and are used for different facets of
              the applications.</p>

            <p>The last decade has also seen the rise of Mozilla
              Firefox, a web browser whose <code>UI</code> and
              functionality are themselves written in (dialects
              of) <code>HTML</code>, <code>CSS</code>,
              and <code>JS</code>, making Firefox one of the first
              fully-fledged web apps.  Part of Firefox's appeal is its
              strong support for <i>extensions</i>, which are
              downloadable, third-party pieces of code (ie, not
              written by Mozilla or with Mozilla's cooperation) that
              enhance the browser with additional functionality or
              customizations.  Firefox extensions are wildly popular:
              over six thousand distinct extensions have been
              downloaded over 2.5 billion times, and all major browser
              vendors have added varying degrees of support for
              extensions to their own products.  Crucially, these
              extensions are also written
              in <code>HTML</code>, <code>CSS</code>,
              and <code>JS</code>: writing an extension feels
              fundamentally similar to writing a web page or web
              app.</p>

            <p>Thanks to the dynamic, interpreted nature of these
              three languages, it is mostly straightforward to
              incorporate the contents of an extension into the
              existing browser.  There are, however, some caveats.
              Not all programs are equally amenable to <i>post-hoc</i>
              extension, and there are currently no guarantees that
              multiple extensions do not <i>conflict</i>,
              destabilizing each other or the base browser.</p>

            <p>In this dissertation, I aim to provide better support
              for rich extensibility for web apps.  In particular, I
              claim that</p>

            <p style="text-align: center;"><i> Language-specific
                extension mechanisms are needed for each
                of <code>HTML</code>, <code>CSS</code>,
                and <code>JS</code>, and such mechanisms are needed
                for building useful diagnostic tools to address
                inter-extension conflicts.</i>
            </p>

            <p>To support this thesis, I first present C3, the
              &ldquo;Cloud Computing Client&rdquo;, an implementation
              of
              the <code>HTML</code>/<code>CSS</code>/<code>JS</code>
              platform architected explicitly to support
              experimentation with extensibility.  I then define two
              such extension mechanisms for <code>HTML</code> and for
              <code>JS</code>: <i>overlays</i> and <i>aspects</i>, respectively.  I
              develop conflict analyses for <code>HTML</code> overlays, and
              evaluate them on a sample of Firefox extensions.
              Conflict analyses for <code>JS</code> are sketched, and extension
              mechanisms for <code>CSS</code> are left for future work.  </p>
