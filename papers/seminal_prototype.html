            <h2>SEMINAL: Prototype implementation</h2>
            <h3>Installation</h3>
            <p>
              Our prototype implementation is available for download
              as a patch on the sources of ocaml-3.08.4.  It is made
              available under the same <a
              href="http://caml.inria.fr/ocaml/license.fr.html">license</a>
              as Objective Caml itself.  To install:
            </p>
            <ol>
              <li>Make sure you have a version of ocaml installed
                already, to bootstrap the compilation.</li>
              <li>Download <a href="http://caml.inria.fr/pub/distrib/ocaml-3.08/ocaml-3.08.4.tar.gz">the ocamlc-3.08.4 sources</a>,
                and unzip to a directory of your choosing.</li>
              <li>Download <a href="files/seminal_v0.0.3.patch">the
                  Seminal patch</a>.  To apply it, change into the top
                directory of the unzipped Ocaml sources, and run
                <code>patch -p1 &lt; path/to/seminal.patch</code></li>
              <li>As usual, 
                <code>./configure ; make world.opt ; make
                  install</code></li>
              <li>This release provides drop-in replacements for
                <code>ocamlc</code> and <code>ocamlc.opt</code>.  To
                see the Seminal suggestions, use the
                <code>-seminal</code> command-line flag.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Feedback and Support</h3>
            <p>If you're using our prototype, please email us to let
              us know how you're using it (just checking it out, using
              it yourself, or for a class, or whatever) and what you
              think of it.</p>
            <p>Seminal is not currently under active development, but
              if there is sufficient interest we will be maintaining
              it and fixing particularly problematic bugs.  We'd
              appreciate your feedback.</p>
