            <h3>Abstract</h3>
	    <p>The <i>World model</i> is an existing functional
	      input-output mechanism for event-driven programming. It
	      is used in numerous popular textbooks and curricular
	      settings.</p>

            <p>The World model conflates two different tasks---the definition of
              an event processor and its execution---into one. This conflation
              imposes a significant (even unacceptable) burden on student users
              in several educational settings where we have tried to use it,
              e.g., for teaching physics.</p>

            <p>While it was tempting to pile on features to address these
              issues, we instead used the Scheme language design dictum of
              removing weaknesses that made them seem necessary. By separating
              the two tasks above, we arrived at a slightly different
              primitive, the <i>reactor</i>, as our basis. This only defines the event
              processor, and a variety of execution operators dictate how it
              runs.</p>

            <p>The new design enables programmatic control over event-driven
              programs. This simplifies reflecting on program behavior, and
              eliminates many unnecessary curricular dependencies imposed by
              the old design. This work has been implemented in the Pyret
              programming language. The separation of concerns has enabled new
              curricula, such as the Bootstrap:Physics curriculum, to take
              flight. Thousands of students use this new mechanism every
              year. We believe that reducing impedance mismatches improves
              their educational experience.</p>
