            <h3>Abstract</h3>
            <p>Modern systems consist of large numbers of languages,
              frameworks, libraries, APIs, and more. Each has
              characteristic behavior and data. Capturing these in
              semantics is valuable not only for understanding them
              but also essential for formal treatment (such as
              proofs). Unfortunately, most of these systems are
              defined primarily through implementations, which means
              the semantics needs to be \emph{learned}. We describe
              the problem of learning a semantics, provide a
              structuring process that is of potential value, and also
              outline our failed attempts at achieving this so
              far.</p>
