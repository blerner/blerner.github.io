            <h3>Abstract</h3>

            <p>Atomicity has been studied extensively as a tool for
              simplifying a programmer's understanding of concurrent
              code. The challenge of atomicity analysis is to precisely
              find those code sections of interest that do obey an
              atomicity discipline. In this paper, we present an
              extension to Farzan and Madhusudan's work on Causal
              Atomicity, adapting the purity analysis proposed by
              Flanagan et. al.  to the Petri-net setting. Our work is
              compositional&mdash;a different purity analysis could be
              implemented with minimal extra effort, and similarly
              another atomicity criterion could be checked without
              changing the purity translation&mdash;and
              compatible&mdash;the analysis of any program that does not
              use purity annotations is trivially equivalent to the
              original analysis.
