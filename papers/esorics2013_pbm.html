            <h3>Abstract</h3>
	    <p>Modern web browsers implement a private browsing mode
	      that is intended to leave behind no traces of a user's
	      browsing activity on their computer. Currently, browser
	      vendors ensure they have implemented this intent through
	      subtle, whole-program reasoning about the browser.  As a
	      result, this feature is in direct tension with support
	      for extensions, which let users add third-party
	      functionality into their browser.  To date, Mozilla and
	      Google have taken different approaches in their support
	      for extensions in private browsing mode, but both
	      approaches are suboptimal and neither can reliably
	      verify the behavior of extensions.</p>

	    <p>We tackle this problem by creating a type system to
	      analyze JavaScript extensions for observation of private
	      browsing mode. Using this type system, extension authors
	      and app stores can convince themselves of an extension's
	      safety for private browsing mode. In addition, some
	      extensions intentionally violate the private browsing
	      guarantee; our type system accommodates this with a
	      small annotation overhead, proportional to the degree of
	      violation. These annotations let code auditors narrow
	      their focus to a small fraction of the extension's
	      codebase.</p>
		
	    <p>This paper explains the design of the type system,
	      highlighting the new features needed to handle
	      potentially-but-not-always unsafe APIs.  We evaluate our
	      system by retrofitting type annotations to Firefox's
	      APIs and to a sample of actively used Firefox
	      extensions, and discuss some of the challenges
	      involved. Finally, we used the type system to verify
	      several extensions as safe, find actual bugs in several
	      others (which have been confirmed by their authors), and
	      find dubious behavior in the rest.</p>
