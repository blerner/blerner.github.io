            <h3>Abstract</h3>
	    <p>JavaScript programs vary widely in functionality,
	      complexity, and use, and analyses of these programs must
	      accommodate such variations. Type-based analyses are
	      typically the simplest such analyses, but due to the
	      language’s subtle idioms and many application-specific
	      needsranging from general-purpose program type-checking
	      to verifying security properties to typing library
	      usagewe have found that a single type system does not
	      work well in all contexts. However, these different uses
	      still share many common elements that can be extended
	      and adapted for each setting.</p>

	    <p>In this paper we present TeJaS, a framework for
	      building type systems for JavaScript. TeJaS has been
	      engineered modularly to encourage experimentation. TeJaS
	      reifies its initial type environment, allowing for easy
	      modeling of the various execution contexts of JavaScript
	      programs, and its type language and typing rules are
	      extensible, allowing for variations of the type system
	      to be constructed easily.</p>

	    <p>The paper presents the base TeJaS type system, which
	      performs traditional type-checking for
	      JavaScript. Because JavaScript demands complex types, we
	      explain several design decisions to improve user
	      ergonomics. We then describe TeJaS’s modular structure,
	      and illustrate it by reconstructing the essence of a
	      very different type system for JavaScript. Systems built
	      from TeJaS have been applied to several real-world,
	      third-party JavaScript programs.</p>
