            <h3>Abstract</h3>
            <p>We present S5, a semantics for the strict mode of the
	      ECMAScript 5.1 (JavaScript) programming language. S5
	      shrinks the large source language into a manageable core
	      through an implemented transformation.  The resulting
	      specification has been tested against realworld
	      conformance suites for the language.  This paper focuses
	      on two aspects of S5: accessors (getters and setters)
	      and <code>eval</code>. Since these features are complex
	      and subtle in JavaScript, they warrant special
	      study. Variations on both features are found in several
	      other programming languages, so their study is likely to
	      have broad applicability.
