            <h3>Abstract</h3>
            <p>We propose that secondary-school data-science
            curricula should be based on four key ingredients: two
            are technical (programming and statistics, with
            visualization sitting at their intersection), while two
            are human-facing (meaningful domains, and civic
            responsibility). We describe their relationship and argue
            for their importance.Based on this, we then present the
            Bootstrap:Data Science curriculum, designed for
            integration into multiple disciplines and settings. It
            achieves this by (a) being designed as a set of
            remix-able lessons, and (b) letting classes and students
            choose personally meaningful datasets.We also initiate
            the process of evaluating this curriculum. We create two
            assessment instruments, one focused on learning and the
            other on personalization and engagement. We provide very
            preliminary data gathered from students and teachers.</p>
