            <h3>Abstract</h3>
	    <p>Recent work has proposed a promising approach to
	    improving scalability of program synthesis by allowing
	    the user to supply a syntactic template that constrains
	    the space of potential programs. Unfortunately, creating
	    templates often requires nontrivial effort from the user,
	    which impedes the usability of the synthesizer. We
	    present a solution to this problem in the context of
	    recursive transformations on algebraic data-types. Our
	    approach relies on polymorphic synthesis constructs: a
	    small but powerful extension to the language of syntactic
	    templates, which makes it possible to define a program
	    space in a concise and highly reusable manner, while at
	    the same time retains the scalability benefits of
	    conventional templates. This approach enables end-users
	    to reuse predefined templates from a library for a wide
	    variety of problems with little effort. The paper also
	    describes a novel optimization that further improves the
	    performance and the scalability of the system. We
	    evaluated the approach on a set of benchmarks that most
	    notably includes desugaring functions for lambda
	    calculus, which force the synthesizer to discover Church
	    encodings for pairs and boolean operations.</p>
