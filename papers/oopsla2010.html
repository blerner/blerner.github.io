            <h3>Abstract</h3>
            <p>Web sites and web browsers have recently evolved into platforms on
              top of which entire applications are delivered dynamically, mostly as
              JavaScript source code. This delivery format has sparked extremely
              enthusiastic efforts to customize both individual web sites and
              entire browsers in ways the original authors never expected or
              accommodated. Such customizations take the form of yet more
              script dynamically injected into the application, and the current
              idioms to do so exploit arcane JavaScript features and are extremely
              brittle. In this work, we accept the popularity of extensions and seek
              better linguistic mechanisms to support them.
            </p>
            <p>We suggest adding to JavaScript aspect-oriented features that
              allow straightforward and declarative ways for customization code
              to modify the targeted application. Compared to most prior aspect-related
              research, our work has a different motivation and a very
              different target programming environment, both of which lead to
              novel design and implementation techniques. In particular, our
              aspect weaving is entirely integrated into a dynamic JIT compiler,
              which lets us properly handle advice to first-class functions in the
              presence of arbitrary aliasing, without resorting to whole-program
              code transformations. Our prototype demonstrates that an aspect-oriented
              approach to web-application customization is often more
              efficient than current idioms while simplifying the entire process.
            </p>
