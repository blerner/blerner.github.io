            <h3>Abstract</h3>
            <p>
              The common conception of a (client-side) web application
              is some collection of HTML, CSS and JavaScript (JS) that
              is hosted within a web browser and that interacts with
              the user in some non-trivial ways. The common conception
              of a web browser is a monolithic program that can render
              HTML, execute JS, and gives the user a portal to
              navigate the web. Both of these are misconceptions:
              nothing inherently confines webapps to a browser&rsquo;s
              page-navigation idiom, and browsers can do far more than
              merely render content. Indeed, browsers and web apps are
              converging in functionality, but their underlying
              technologies are so far largely distinct.
            </p>

              We present C3, an implementation of the HTML/CSS/JS
              platform designed for web-client research and
              experimentation. C3&rsquo;s typesafe, modular
              architecture lowers the barrier to webapp and browser
              research. Moreover, C3 explores the role of
              extensibility throughout the web platform for
              customization and research efforts, by introducing novel
              extension points and generalizing existing ones. We
              discuss and evaluate C3&rsquo;s design choices for
              flexibility, and provide examples of various extensions
              that we and others have built.
            </p>
