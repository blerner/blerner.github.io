            <h3>Abstract</h3>
            <p>
	      The jQuery library defines a powerful <i>query
		language</i> for web applications' scripts to interact
	      with Web page content.  This language is exposed as
	      jQuery's API, which is implemented to fail silently so
	      that incorrect queries will not cause the program to
	      halt.  Since the correctness of a query depends on the
	      structure of a page, discrepancies between the page's
	      actual structure and what the query expects will also
	      result in failure, but with no error traces to
	      indicate where the mismatch occurred.
	    </p>
	    <p>
	      This work proposes a novel type system to statically
	      detect jQuery errors.  The type system extends Typed
	      JavaScript with <i>local structure</i> about the page
	      and with <i>multiplicities</i> about the structure of
	      containers.  Together, these two extensions allow us to
	      track precisely which nodes are active in a jQuery
	      object, with minimal programmer annotation effort.  We
	      evaluate this work by applying it to sample real-world
	      jQuery programs.
