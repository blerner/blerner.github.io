            <h3>Abstract</h3>

            <p>Atomicity-checking is a powerful approach for finding
              subtle concurrency errors in shared-memory multithreaded
              code. The goal is to verify that certain code sections
              appear to execute atomically to all other threads. This
              paper extends Farzan and Madhusudan's recent work on
              causal atomicity, which uses a translation to Petri nets
              to avoid much of the imprecision of type-system based
              approaches, to support purity annotations in the style of
              Flanagan et al.  Purity avoids imprecision for several key
              idioms, but it has previously been used only in the
              type-system setting. Our work is (1) compositional: a
              different purity analysis could be implemented with
              minimal extra effort, and similarly another atomicity
              criterion could be checked without changing the purity
              analysis, and (2) a conservative extension: the analysis
              of any program that does not use purity annotations is
              equivalent to the original analysis.
