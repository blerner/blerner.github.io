            <h3>Abstract</h3>
            <p>
	      Web applications are fundamentally reactive. Code in a
	      web page runs in reaction to events, which are triggered
	      either by external stimuli or by other events. The DOM,
	      which specifies these behaviors, is therefore central to
	      the behavior of web applications. We define the first
	      formal model of event behavior in the DOM, with high
	      fidelity to the DOM specification. Our model is concise
	      and executable, and can therefore be used for testing
	      and verification. We have applied it in several
	      settings: to establish some intended meta-properties of
	      the DOM, as an oracle for testing the behavior of
	      browsers (where it found real errors), to demonstrate
	      unwanted interactions between extensions and validate
	      corrections to them, and to examine the impact of a web
	      sandbox. The model composes easily with models of other
	      web components, as a step toward full formal modeling of
	      the web.
