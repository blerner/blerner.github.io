            <h3>Abstract</h3>
            <p>Interactive evaluation with a REPL (Read-Eval-Print Loop) is a feature
                of many programming environments, especially in environments for
                teaching programming. However, REPLs do have confusions and stumbles
                for beginners related to navigating between programs and interactive
                evaluation. We identify several specific weaknesses of REPLs with a
                worked example from an existing programming environment in active use,
                distilled from our experience with novices. We then present an updated
                programming environment that mitigates these weaknesses by combining
                the program editor and REPL, so the user can benefit from the best of both.</p>
