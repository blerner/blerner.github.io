        Welcome!  You've reached the appendices, as it were, of
        this website.  The part of the story which gives
        insight into the author, tells a brief anecdote or
        two, and then rolls on into whatever else may be relevant.
        At the moment, I don't have all that much to say.  But
        watch this space; amusing bits should accumulate here eventually.
      </p>
      <p>Below are recently collected musings, resources, and
        miscellany, which interested me enough to post them
        here.  Hopefully, they will interest you too.

      <h2>&quot;Why do they call it rush hour when nothing
        moves?&quot;</h2>
      <p>If you've lived in Seattle and ever had to go to
        Redmond or Bellevue, you know the feeling.  Believe it
        or not, there are occasionally compelling reasons to
        travel the highways.  Here are a few:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><span class="label">Hiking</span>.  While walking
          eastwards through downtown Seattle should count as a
          category-three climb, there are much more scenic
          places around.  Some favorites include Mt. Pilchuck,
          Mt. Rainier, and most of the Mountain Loop Highway.
        </li>
        <li><span class="label"><a
                                   href="http://www.despair.com/in24x30prin.html">Skiing</a></span>.  
          I'd like to improve on this one this year.  Recent
          slopes have included Stevens Pass and Crystal
          Mountain; I'm hoping to get back up to Whistler this
          season.
        </li>
        <li><span class="label">Food</span>.  There are lots of
          good restaurants nearby, if you have the patience to
          look for them.  The international district has many
          (<a
              href="http://seattle.citysearch.com/profile/10776824/seattle_wa/sichuanese_chinese.html">Sichuanese Chinese</a> being a recent great find),
          Redmond Town Center is a good standby, and (if you can
          find parking), Belltown and the market area.
        </li>
        <li><span class="label">The airport</span>.  I'm always
          happy to pick up visitors from the airport, so if
          you'd like to come visit, let me know.  Conversely,
          I'm usually willing to drive myself down to the
          airport to visit other people, though the bus is more
          convenient.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <!--            <h2>&quot;My computer won't work, can you fix it?&quot;</h2>
                      <p>While I can't be certain, it's fairly likely you've
                        heard this one before, or perhaps even asked it
                        yourself.  So here are some tidbits and tips I've picked
                        up along the way; perhaps they'll help you too.

      <h2>&quot;The price of reliability is the pursuit of the
        utmost simplicity&quot;</h2>
      <p>Tony Hoare, in his Turing Aware lecture, described his
        experiences over twenty years of software design, and
        this maxim still rings true today.  Our systems are
        magnitudes more capable and more complex now than in
        1980, and reliability is more an issue now than ever
        before.
