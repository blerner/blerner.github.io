    <h3>Motivation</h3>
    <p>
      Many systems are <i>extensible</i>: they offer users a
      way to expand the capabilities of the program beyond
      those built in.  Some extensibility is limited in scope:
      for example, media players allow the installation of new
      codecs, but do not typically allow new extensions to,
      say, add support for internet radio if some rudimentary
      support did not already exist.  Other systems are
      nothing but extensions: the emacs text editor and the
      Eclipse development environment are composed of
      (comparatively) small kernels and suites of packages
      that make the kernels useful.  There is a price for this
      flexibility, though.  The greater the power of
      extensions, the more likely independent extensions are
      incompatible with each other.
    </p>
    <p>
      Designing a system for extensibility involves several
      coordinated decisions, such as the scope of extension,
      what hooks or extension points are visible, what
      interactions between extensions are possible, etc.
      Choosing poorly on any of these axes can cripple the
      extension system's popularity or usefulness.  Choosing a
      poor programming model for the extension points may make
      debugging extensions very difficult, precisely when they
      break and debugging is needed.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Firefox web browser is built on a very widely
      extensible platform.  Extensions can hook practically
      anything, at any time, leading to a very flexible,
      powerful model.  Moreover, extensions are easy to program,
      involving nothing fundamentally harder than programming a
      web page.  This has led to wildly surging popularity, with
      over <i>10 thousand</i> extensions downloaded over <i>2
        billion</i> times by over <i>100 million</i> users.  But
      when these extensions conflict with each other, diagnosing
      the problem is particularly difficult.  Firefox is
      therefore an ideal testbed for extension conflict: it is
      highly visible, very powerful, and improving it would
      directly help millions of users.
    </p>
    <h3>Approach</h3>
    <p>An extension is a self-contained piece of code that
      inserts itself in various places in the browser in order
      to implement its feature.  In other words, it is very much
      like <i>aspect-oriented</i> coding, which similarly weaves
      advice code into a mainline program.  The fundamental
      difference here is that extensions are always written by
      people other than the browser developers, whereas
      typically aspects are written by the mainline authors.
      Our first effort, therefore, has been to add aspects to
      Javascript, so that we can rewrite extensions more
      declaratively, to state explicitly what they're hooking in
      the browser.  This work has been done in Spur, a Microsoft
      Research JScript compiler.</p>
    <p>Additional work is under way to explore other forms of
      extension hooks, such as how overlays inject new content
      into HTML, and characterize the kinds of conflicts those
      hooks entail.  Knowing this, we can begin to develop
      static analyses that detect weaving violations or other
      semantic problems, and thereby detect when extensions
      conflict.</p>
